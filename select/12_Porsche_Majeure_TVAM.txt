This house is not a home
Rollcage and Crumple Zone
Freedom is Violence
You have everything you need

Tear away through burning grass
Bruised chrome and broken glass
First man and then machine
Unlike any other

Feel the push of an unseen hand
Control Without Command
From Driveways of Suburban Homes
We go anywhere we please

Feel the pulse of a pierced aorta
We can all breathe underwater
Always there for you
There is no substitute

You will never feel alone again
You will never feel alone again
You will never feel alone again
You will never feel alone again
